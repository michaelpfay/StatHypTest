# List of Corrections to: Statistical Hypothesis Testing in Context
## by Michael P. Fay and Erica H. Brittain


  **p. 206, line -9:** 
   
   The expression
   "...we test all
   
```math
\begin{pmatrix}
k \\
k-1
\end{pmatrix}
= k-1 
```

null hypotheses that have $k-1$ distributions equal."

should be
"...we test all   

```math
\begin{pmatrix}
k \\
k-1
\end{pmatrix}
= k
```

null hypotheses that have $k$ distributions equal." (Thanks to Pekka Pere of Aalto University for catching this error.)
