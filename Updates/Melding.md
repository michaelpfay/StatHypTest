**Update on Melding**

We described melding as (p. 185) "a very general way of combining two nested, valid, central intervals from independent sources 
that gives inferences that are automatically efficient and are designed to be valid for any sample size." We say "designed to be 
valid" and later (p. 190) "conjectured to be valid", but validity was not proven for all cases. Important uses are melding for the two-sample binomial 
problem  and  melding for the difference in medians. Although all calculations still suggest that the melding intervals for the 
two-sample  binomial problem are valid, we now know that the melding for the difference in medians (p. 142) is not valid for all 
situations. Frey and Zhang (The American Statistician, https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2023.2257253 ) have shown a counter-example 
where the difference in medians melded interval is not valid.
